# IBM-Data-Science Fundamental to scalable data science
Functional programming makes the use of lambda calculus, also known as inline function. It use the mathematical model and convert it in to anonymus runtime function.
In Functional programming .py - I have used apache spark map function to map lambda to dataset and next used reduce function to calculate the summation of n numbers.
